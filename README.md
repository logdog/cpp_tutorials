# cpp_tutorials

Figured if I know Java, Python, Javascript, and want to become an EE major, I best touch up on my cpp skills. This repository doesn't include any of my Arduino projects (because that's not really cpp).

### To compile in C++ 11 on mac:
```
clang++ -std=c++11 -stdlib=libc++ -Weverything <cpp_files> -o <exe_name>
```
### To execute in BASH
```
./<exe_name>
```
